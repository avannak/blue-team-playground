# 🛡️ Blue Team Security Portfolio – Arthur Vannakittikun

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio! I'm transitioning into the SOC Analyst field, and this repository highlights hands-on security projects I've completed to build real-world detection, investigation, and incident response skills. Since SOC work is typically confidential, I’ve recreated real-world blue team scenarios in this public portfolio to demonstrate how I analyze threats, investigate alerts, and extract IOCs.

## 🎯 About Me

I'm a Computer Science graduate with a background in front-end software engineering, now pivoting into cybersecurity with a focus on Blue Team operations. My goal is to work in a Security Operations Center (SOC) where I can help detect, investigate, and respond to threats that impact real organizations.

## 🔍 What You'll Find Here

Each subfolder contains a lab, report, or hands-on project I’ve completed to showcase specific skills relevant to SOC and Blue Team roles.
